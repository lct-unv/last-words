> ​	This section did not need any reference.

> ​	When I penned down the following sentences of words in this section, i guess that you may be in mixed emotion. Oh, you would respond that you haven’t read them yet. No problem, and then please spend (or waste) about 6 minutes looking through this essay:

> ​	 I simply want to write something and share with you a story that's not too long. If you already have a sense of what's coming and feel awkward about it, then you can stop here. (Of course, if you only read up to here, I'll feel a bit sad.)

> ​	When did I first meet you? I think it was on August 18, 2024. But the first time I heard your name was when our team in 2024 Zhejiang physics innovation competition faced huge difficulties and somebody told me that you were invited to assist repairing our in-program video. I was excited and I realized that perhaps the person might be my potential companion or confidant, but not until the trip started did I know you furthermore. On Sept. 3, 2024, you said that you wanted to join me in writing research articles and you even carefully review my published article (Ref 1). At that time and since then, I time and time again witnessed your passion, though sometimes you were so busy with works in your organization in school. Looking back all six months (over half a season), we had wrote so much research articles and it seemed that you brought much lucky to us, for the nearly 100% peer-review rate and an accepted paper within 2024 Winter...so on.Experiences we had experienced were even in fact uncountable and unforgettable. Such positive and endless support , such a fairy of luck and such a confidant really charmed me.

> ​	I like you, and it's not a fleeting feeling, nor is it driven by mere curiosity—it's simply because I'm genuinely drawn to your personality. I've always believed that the people we meet in life are all a matter of fate. Just knowing you already makes me feel fortunate, but I selfishly want to know more of your story, want to go to many places with you, meet many, many people with you, and hope that we can be more than just friends. Oh no, I have a feeling that by the time you read this, you'll start frowning and feel a bit awkward.

> ​	Originally, I wanted to tell you this face to face, but after careful consideration, I realized that I'd either run out of words or end up blushing deeply. Plus, I thought it would be too painful to be rejected in person. So, after some thought, I decided to write this as a sort of acknowledgement. Mishima Yukio once said: "When I tell you I like you, it's not because I want to be with you, but because I hope that when you encounter low points in life, you won't lose heart. At least you'll know that someone was once attracted to your charm, and that someone still will be in the future." (Mishima Yukio, 2013)

> ​	For over a season, I’ve spent countless nights pondering: Should I tell you this? Can’t we just remain really good friends? In the end, I told myself I had to. Up until now, it’s only been a quiet crush. I’m not someone brave all the time; I get nervous giving presentations, feel incredibly lonely eating alone, and have to think long and hard before speaking. But we all have to grow up, and the brave ones are the first to enjoy the world. Perhaps all my awards, my company, my programs which are in cooperation with School of Physics and my published articles could be proof for this. 

> ​	As a university student who’s no longer so naive, I can clearly distinguish between liking someone and other feelings. On the one hand, liking someone is about mutual support, growth, and progress together. It is the attraction between two interesting souls, united by shared ideals and engaging conversations. It is about helping each other uncover the hidden parts of our inner selves, enabling us to understand who we truly are and illuminating the path ahead. On the other hand, liking someone means taking countless photos just to find topics to talk to you about, wanting to send you pictures of interesting or beautiful sights the moment I see them; liking someone means offering unconditional support, helping you find your own meaning and self-value in this absurd world.

> ​	I’m a slow burner when it comes to relationships. The psychological counselor once said I seem like a little sun, and my high school classmates said I have the ability to heal others. Of course, I'm optimistic as I often and  bring some warmth and joy to you. At least I can always be responsible, reliable, and by your side. I just want to give you a little bit of motivation, so that when you encounter thorns along the way, you'll have less hesitation and anxiety, giving much more chance in trying at a lower cost to trial and error. After all, you are always busy and constantly overworked by teachers.

> ​	I’ve said so much already, and I’m afraid you might get tired reading it, so I’ll wrap this up lightly. I wish the 19-year-old you the freedom, ease, and joy to live each day to the fullest. And about studying—just give your best effort, and focus on being the best version of yourself for now. After all, university is not just about studying.

> ​	I can’t be sure if you're my moon, but your light has certainly shone upon me. 

> ​	Alright, that's all for now,writing for the first author(FN).
